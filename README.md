# Manical-Mages
This is my submission for ITCS-4232 at UNC Charlotte in which I created a game on the application Game Maker. 
This is the README for Maniacal Mages. This file consists of all the current licensing links used within the game for both sprites and sounds. At the bottom consists of the controls and also cheat keys currently implemented within the game. Feel free to use them to efficiently test the game. 

*If you find any game breaking bugs, issues or even any recommendations for the game, please let me know as I would be glad to accomodate/fix issues that I may have not encountered while playtesting*

*Below is a list of functions in the works "(in progress)" that haven't been fully implemented or ideas "(idea)" that I intend to start working on soon to implement into the game to make it better overall*

Incomplete Ideas:
-Health bar for boss (in progress) <br />
-Timer so player takes damage if touching boss/enemies for too long (in progress) <br />
-Health Bar for mage enemies (in progress) <br />
-Mages/Player blinks white/gray when hit by potion or sword (in progress) <br />
-More in depth weapon system including tool bar of all current weapons/potions numbers (idea) <br />
-Expanding world to function as a more openworld game (in progress) <br />
-Disabling Objects and Enemies until they are within viewport to reduce data usage as world expands (idea) <br />
-Blocking mages from attacking through structures/walls (in progress) <br />
-More enemy types as world expands (idea) <br />
-Movement of mages generally towards player when in range rather than completely random (in progress) <br />
